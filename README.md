# todotoday
A simple todo-list web application with facebook integration.

## Purpose
Started last week as a project to develop my skills in PHP.

## Notes
- I'm planning to use jonycheung's [autocompiler][AutoCompiler] to compile the code in /less and output css in /css. The nodejs file that compiles is named watch.js
